<p>This is a solid maple Four-Poster bed that I built for my daughter in 2012. The posts and rails are hard maple and the headboard is soft curly maple that has a nice figure. Draw bolts are used to attach the rails to the posts and I used a shellac with dye as a finish followed with multiple coats of a satin varnish.</p>
